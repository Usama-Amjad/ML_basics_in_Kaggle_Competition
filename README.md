# ML_basics_in_Kaggle_Competition
In this project, we will be able to understand how to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck and make our first submission in an Machine Learning competition inside the Kaggle platform. Also, we as a beginner in Machine Learning applications, will get familiar and get a deep understanding of how to start a model prediction using basic supervised Machine Learning models. We will choose classifiers to learn, predict,  and make an Exploratory Data Analysis (also called EDA). At the end, you will know how to measure a model performance, and submit your model to the competition and get a score from Kaggle.
